    "1.what are the 5 key concepts of oops.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class\n",
    "A class is a template or blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of objects created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes: These are characteristics or properties of an object (for example, color, size, brand in the case of a car).\n",
    "- Methods: These are functions defined inside a class that describe the behavior of an object (for example, start, stop, or drive in a car).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as a plan for building something, like a house. You create different houses (objects) from the same plan (class), but each house may have its own specifics like different paint color or furniture.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model, color):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand  # Attribute\n",
    "        self.model = model  # Attribute\n",
    "        self.color = color  # Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):  # Method\n",
    "        return f\"{self.brand} {self.model}'s engine started.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Object\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object from a class, the object will have all the attributes and methods defined in the class, but with its own unique data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", \"Red\")\n",
    "print(my_car.start_engine())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class (called a *child* or *subclass*) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (called a *parent* or *superclass*). This helps in reusability of code and creates a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Inheritance: One class inherits from another.\n",
    "- Multiple Inheritance: A class can inherit from more than one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ElectricCar(Car):  # ElectricCar inherits from Car\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model, color, battery_capacity):\n",
    "        super().__init__(brand, model, color)  # Inheriting from Car\n",
    "        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity  # New attribute for ElectricCar\n",
    "\n",
    "    def charge_battery(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.brand} {self.model} is charging. Battery capacity: {self.battery_capacity}kWh.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that work on the data within one unit (class). It also refers to the restriction of direct access to some of an object's attributes, using methods to control how these attributes are accessed or modifie\n",
    "- Public attributes/methods: Accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "- Protected attributes/methods: Denoted by a single underscore `_` (can be accessed by subclasses, but conventionally treated as non-public).\n",
    "- Private attributes/methods**: Denoted by a double underscore `__` (cannot be accessed directly outside the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance  # Encapsulation: controlling access to the balance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. It also refers to the ability to define methods in different classes that share the same name but behave differently depending on the object that is calling them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types:\n",
    "- Method Overriding: A child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "- Method Overloading (not directly supported in Python, but can be simulated): Having multiple methods with the same name but different arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Some sound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_animal_sound(animal):\n",
    "    print(animal.sound())\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",

    "3. Explain the difference between instance methods and class methods. Provide an example of each.\n",
    "1. Instance Methods\n",
    "Definition: Instance methods are the most common type of method in a class. They operate on the instance of the class, meaning they can access and modify the attributes of that particular instance.\n",
    "Access: They can access the instance and modify the instance attributes.\n",
    "Declaration: Instance methods are defined using def and take self as their first parameter.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",

    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020)\n",
    "print(my_car.display_info())  \n",
    "2. Class Methods\n",
    "Definition: Class methods are methods that are bound to the class itself, not the individual instances. They cannot modify instance-specific attributes but can modify class-level attributes (shared by all instances).\n",
    "Access: Class methods use cls as the first parameter instead of self, which refers to the class itself, not an instance.\n",
    "Declaration: Class methods are marked with the @classmethod decorator before the method definition.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    total_cars = 0  \n",

    "5. What are the three types of access modifiers in Python? How are they denoted?\n",
    "In Python, access modifiers control the accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). Python has three levels of access:\n",

    "\n",
