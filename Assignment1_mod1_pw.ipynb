    "1. Explain the key feature of python that make it popular choice for programming.\n",
    "1)Readable and Simple:\n",
    "Python syntax  is designed to be easy to read and understand, the use of indentation for code blocks instead of braces enhances readability and reduces the chances of errors. \n",
    "2)Dynamic Typing:\n",
    "Python allows to assign different data types to variables at runtime ,that making it more flexible compared to statistically typed languages.\n",
    "3)Object-Oriented Programming:\n",
    "Python supports encapsulation ,inheritance , polymorphism .\n",
    "Encapsulation: Python supports encapsulation, allowing you to group data and functions together into objects.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance enables you to create new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes.\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same type.\n",
    "4)Versatility and Applicability\n",
    "Wide Range of Application: Python can be used for various tasks, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, automation, and more.\n"
